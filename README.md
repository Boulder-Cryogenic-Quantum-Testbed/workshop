In appropriately frigid weather, we conducted the inaugural “Cryogenic Resonator Workshop” in Boulder, Colorado.  
The goal was to establish a direction for our Resonator Standard Testbed program. In order to do this, we wanted 
the unvarnished take from scientists performing these measurements regularly. So we hosted a workshop where the 
participants discussed the details of the experiments that wouldn’t make into a march meeting talk or PRL. 

We had attendees from a variety of groups (academic, industrial and national labs) a great deal of participation
in the sessions. Participants shared details of their experimental setups and spoke frankly about open questions 
in the field. The slides from the workshop are curated here. 

## Highlights:

There was broad agreement at the workshop on the following:

* That there is a large amount of ambiguity in resonator measurement setups. 
* Several other metrics should routinely be reported in addition to Qi: 
    * uncertainties, 
    * frequency noise (via Pound-Drever-Hall technique), 
    * temperature dependent loss. See slides from Tom Ohki at BBN
* Importance of full chip/package modeling to understand resonator dependent loss due to modes. 
    * Lincoln Labs was able to get much more consistency through full chip modeling and removing nearby lossy materials (silver paint etc).
* Sharing and review of code would benefit the field.
    * Consensus to host standard datasets and design tools. 
    * Google, BBN, Lincoln Labs, Northrop Grumman, Waterloo and NIST are submittin standard resonator datasets. 
* Additionally, participants were open to sharing EM simulation files, GDS designs, etc. 
* Acceptance of open source modules for fitting and analysis.
